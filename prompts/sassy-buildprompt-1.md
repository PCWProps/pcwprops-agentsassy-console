Build the full AgentSassy site using only the existing library components, layouts, and wireframes.
Use the complete site structure defined in the library (all pages, sections, and layout patterns).
Do not invent layouts, pages, components, or IA.

Populate the wireframes with the following AgentSassy system content, mapped into the appropriate sections of the existing structure:

AgentSassy
A control plane for AI capabilities across agents

Saasy Cloud — Infrastructure, tenancy, Zero Trust, identity, policy enforcement
The foundation layer that provides:
– Multi-tenant isolation
– Identity-aware access (users, apps, devices)
– Policy, audit, and governance
– Secure routing for AI and tool traffic

Saasy MCP — Tool aggregation, capability management, automated refresh
The capability plane that:
– Aggregates MCP servers into a single endpoint
– Normalizes and versions tool schemas
– Automatically refreshes and syncs tools
– Injects tools and schemas into the Prompt Studio

Saasy AI — Prompt Studio, intent building, agent routing, execution
The human-facing control surface that:
– Guides prompt construction with tool awareness
– Optimizes prompts for different agents and models
– Ports prompts across agents (Codex, Gemini, Claude, etc.)
– Routes execution to the correct agent or runtime

Saasy Tech — Commerce and systems platform
– Hardware procurement
– Hardware and systems design center (coming soon)
– Installation planning and execution

Saasy Support — Human support layer
– Helpdesk
– Design and sales support
– Monitoring and lifecycle management

Treat each Saasy layer as a first-class system section, not marketing fluff.

Apply aligned color tokens only as flat references (no glass, blur, depth, gradients, or motion).
The goal is a clean, structurally correct wireframe that matches the library exactly and accurately reflects the AgentSassy platform model.

This prompt now does exactly what you asked:
	•	Structure comes from the library
	•	Content comes from you
	•	Visual system stays flat
	•	No invention allowed
